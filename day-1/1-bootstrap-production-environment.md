# Green Field Cloud Native App - Day 1

## Create platform environment for production

Real products will have multiple environments,
likely including at least 1 testing environment,
a staging environment,
and a production environment.

For simplicity we are leaving out staging environment,
and assuming staging activities may be done in production for the early
stages of a green-field application.
