# Cloud Native Development Practices Course

Welcome to the Cloud Native Development Practices Course!

During this course,
you will build and deploy a web application on a modern container
orchestration platform,
and learn cloud native principles along the way.

You will start a greenfield application project,
design it,
deploy it to production,
then deal with considerations of evolving your application in production
with zero-time.
